# Mini Christmas Letter
*By Kayla & Zach Francis* <br>

We are a boring couple. Zach's hands are a little bit dry, but he doesn't moisturize them. Kayla is convinced everyone is going to kill her, and refuses to get life insurance to avoid motivating people going through with it. Zach is a couch potato who would play video games all day if society would let him. Kayla is a hard worker, who knows all of the things that need to get done. We don't attend Great Gatsby parties, we don't travel as much as we used to, and we don't have a million followers on our Instagram. Or, Instagram accounts. But we do have each other. That's enough for us, and maybe it will be enough for a few random souls on the internet to keep reading our blog.

Our first post is called a mini Christmas Letter because we sent out a Christmas letter to our friends and family (with physical paper and everything). It gave a brief update of our life, and that's what we want to do with our first post here, except smaller.

Kayla is from a small town in Wisconsin where she grew up on a farm, while Zach grew up in the suburbs of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Kayla rode horses, saved a goat from slaughter, went canoeing, and trapped a lot of toads. Zach imagined having his own Pok√©mon, explored the woods with his dog, went extreme hill-climbing, and hid in the darkness of his basement. Somehow, all of these experiences led them to an archaeological excavation in Ukraine, where Kayla and Zach met. We were friends for 2 years, before they decided to sway with each other like chameleons.

We got married in June of 2021, moved into a new house that same month, and have been bashing our brains in fixing the place ever since. Things are starting to look up, however. We were able to get a lot of major repairs done to get things feeling like home. Working from home sometimes has it feeling a bit too much like home, but we love our place regardless. Our marriage is also going swimmingly. Even after being together for almost 5 years and living together for 3, it still feels like we are on an adventure with each other.

This may not seem like a mini-Christmas letter, but it's much shorter than the one we sent out. Hopefully our future blogs will be more interesting and focused. Our goal isn't to gain a million Instagram followers. Our goal is tell our stories in a way that we don't find our own stories boring. And maybe some day, somebody besides ourselves will read this. If you are, then thank you. Welcome aboard the VodkaWagon.
